   cd <main.py>
   ```

2. Ensure the script file has execution permissions (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x file_manager.py
   ```

## Usage
Open the dist folder and run the .exe file. 

            Or

## Notes

- Color-coded messages indicate success (green), errors (red), and menu options (yellow).
- Ensure appropriate permissions for reading, writing, or executing files.
